# Project Title

A dynamic website with user interaction and data from an external API

## Project Description

My project will require user interaction capturing inputted data. The data inputted will use BALLDONTLIE API to fetch a nba player from the api and display his measurements. The APi only fetches 25 players in the nba alphabetically. I will provide a list of players that the api uses so that we can test the api.
